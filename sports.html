                but my main passion would be horse riding;<br> which I have done from a very young age. 
                I regularly compete in Showjumping competitions and also breed pedigree horses in my family's equestrian centre. <br>

            There are many professional showjumpers I admire such as Cian O'Connor, Bertram Allen, Jessica Curtin and also a good friend of mine, Shane O'Reilly.

            trust in a huge creature to translate your commands and execute them safely and with accuracy.<br>
