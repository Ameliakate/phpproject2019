            <p>One of my favourite things to do is travel and experience new and different cultures. I plan to travel to as many places as I possibly can.<br>
            I have been lucky enough to have visited some incredibly beautiful places like Italy, France, Spain, Holland, Germany, Greece etc. <br>
            I've even been surprised with a hot air balloon ride over Segovia, Madrid- which I would HIGHLY recommend! Absolutely incredible experience <br>
            where I also got to meet and converse with very interesting people from all over the world. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Out of everywhere I've been so far, my two favourite places have to be Mykonos-Greece and Madrid-Spain.<br>
                Those two places absolutely blew me away with their beauty.</p> <br>
            
            There are so many more places I plan to travel to, but my top 5 would be;<br>
